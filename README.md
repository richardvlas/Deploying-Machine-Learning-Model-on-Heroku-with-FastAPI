# Deploying Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI



## Project Structure
The project includes the following files and folders:

```bash
# TODO
```

## Preliminary steps

### Clone the Project
Clone the repository locally so that you can use it:

```bash
https://github.com/richardvlas/Deploying-Machine-Learning-Model-on-Heroku-with-FastAPI.git
```

and go into the repository:

```bash
cd Deploying-Machine-Learning-Model-on-Heroku-with-FastAPI
```

### Create environment
Make sure to have conda installed and ready, then create a new environment and install `python==3.8`. Once this is done activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda create -n heroku_with_fastapi "python==3.8"
conda activate heroku_with_fastapi
```

Now install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Set Up Data Version Control (DVC)
Create a directory for the project and initialize Git and DVC.
As you work on the code, continually commit changes. Trained models you want to keep must be committed to DVC.

Add we will later connect this to AWS S3.
